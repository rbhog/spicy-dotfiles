# spicy-dotfiles
my dotfiles... (please redirect yourself to the dotfiles of aidangoettsch and cf12)
At the moment meant for Arch/Manjaro but I do wish to expand that

> Note: there appears to be 2 folders for neovim (nvim and neovim). The correct folder is nvim for some odd reason and I will make sure that it is actually possible to open it in the next couple days.

*I really want to make some kind of install script. Once standardized exam preparation ends I will put effort into that. Please feel free to PR any kinds of improvements you would like to see for this (that means you Aidan and Brian).*
